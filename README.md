## Opportunities
<strong>Collaboration: </strong>The collaboration between Development, Operations, and a newly formed DevOps team can help break down silos and improve communication and collaboration across departments. This can benefit the QA team by fostering better teamwork.<br>
<strong>Continuous Testing:</strong> DevOps encourages continuous integration and continuous delivery (CI/CD), which means that testing is integrated into the development pipeline. This allows the QA team to conduct continuous testing, identify issues earlier in the development process, and ensure better software quality.<br>
<strong>Automation: </strong>Automation is a core aspect of DevOps, including automated testing. The QA team can leverage this to automate repetitive testing tasks, reducing the manual testing effort and increasing efficiency.<br>
<strong>Feedback Loop:</strong> DevOps emphasizes rapid feedback, which means the QA team can receive quick feedback on the quality of the software. This feedback loop enables faster issue resolution and better responsiveness to changes.<br>

##### QA team's role within the DevOps
<p> ** *Quality Assurance Strategy ***: The QA team can develop and implement a strategy for the organization, so to define the QA processes and streamline the tools used</p>
<p>**Automation**: The QA team should automate testing processes and collaborate with the Development and Operations teams to create automated test scripts that run in the CI/CD pipeline.</p>
<p>**Collaboration**: QA team members should work closely with developers, operations, and other stakeholders to ensure that testing is integrated throughout the software delivery process.</p>
<p>**Continuous Improvement**: The QA team should participate in retrospectives and feedback sessions to identify areas for improvement in the development and testing processes.</p>
<p>**Monitoring and Feedback**: QA should focus on continuous monitoring and provide feedback on the quality of software in real-time, allowing for quick issue resolution.</p>
<p>**Security and Compliance**: QA should play a critical role in ensuring security and compliance testing is integrated into the DevOps pipeline.</p>
